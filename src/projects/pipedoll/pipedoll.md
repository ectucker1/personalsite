[PipeDoll](https://github.com/ectucker1) is a 2D motion capture animation addon for the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
It uses [Google's MediaPipe library](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) to capture motion data using a standard webcam.
This creates something like a paper doll animation.

The project originated at a Hackathon where my team developed a game using MediaPipe to record animations.
That version was a cobbled together as most Hackathon code is, and required running a Python webserver to provide data from MediaPipe.
But the results were good enough to inspire me to put together a much more usable Godot extension.
