[The Ouroboros Labyrinth](https://ect.itch.io/the-ouroboros-labyrinth) is a puzzle game about a snake eating it's own tail.
It was the 1st Place winner of the 2021 K-State Spring Game Jam.

The game is programmed with the Godot game engine.
The most complicated component by far was the computation of shrinking the snake as it ate.
That system faced several rewrites over the weekend to account for new scenarios and improve performance.
Some of the puzzles stumped me as the creator &mdash; my teammates were pretty devious coming up with them.
