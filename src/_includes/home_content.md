My name is {{ first_name }}!
I'm a software developer and general-purpose oddity tinkerer.
This site is my portfolio/blog/dedicated hyperlink collecting zone.

While I do plenty of technical stuff professionally, this site mostly showcases my personal projects.

Many of these projects are games.
I've been doing gamedev as a hobby for almost 10 years now, starting with my [first Ludum Dare entry](/projects/ld32-golden-spork/) in 2015 (they got better; I swear).
Currently, I'm developing [Random Bullshit Go](/projects/random-bullshit-go/), a real-time online multiplayer card game where timing is everything.

I also make a variety of [electronic and other music](/music/).
I play synthesizer and drum machine in a local indie rock-ish band, which I'll link to as soon as we actually record a song.

I'm always tinkering with, learning about, or reflecting on something, and I'll be posting about that [my blog](/blog).

Outside of the computer, I dabble in sci-fi literature, Magic the Gathering, and obscure rules-light tabletop RPGs.
I'm based out of Kansas.
I'm 24 years old.
And also, I'm trans and proud!

There's a slightly more expansive project list [here](/projects), though I still haven't copied over everything from my [itch.io](https://ect.itch.io/) or [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/users/ectucker1/games/) page.
