This is my blog!
It's mostly intended to be about game development and other technical projects, but I'm sure it'll digress into more personal or serious topics on occasion.
I wouldn't have started a blog if I didn't have opinions ;)

There's an [Atom Feed](/blog/atom.xml) if you want to subscribe.
