I've left a few accounts around the web.
Here I gather and bind them together through the ritual of hyperlinking.

For casual conversation, personal questions, or low-stakes collaborative proposals:
- {% relMe "Mastodon", "https://kind.social/@ectcetera" %}
- {% relMe "Bluesky", "https://bsky.app/profile/ectcetera.bsky.social" %}

For source code or comments on specific projects:
- {% relMe "GitHub", "https://github.com/ectucker1" %}
- {% relMe "GitLab", "https://gitlab.com/ectucker" %}

For playing or reviewing games:
- {% relMe "itch.io", "https://ect.itch.io/" %}
- {% relMe "Ludum Dare", "https://ldjam.com/users/ectucker1/games/" %}

For vaguely-professional _stuff_:
- {% relMe "LinkedIn", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ectucker1/" %}

If you want an email or Discord, ask through one of those other channels.
