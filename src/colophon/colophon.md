### Philosophy

I'm working towards making this site a part of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/).
I believe in having a place to own my own data outside of the large corporate platforms.
And I want to be able to share that place with others!

I _mostly_ try to follow principles of [Brutalist Web Design](https://brutalist-web.design/).
The content comes first!

No generative AI is used in any writing on this site.
What would be the point of having my own website if I was going to let a machine write the words on it?

### Tech

Source code is available in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ectucker1/personalsite).

This is a static site generated by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).
Content is stored in plain text files.
It requires no client side JavaScript.

CSS styles are processed with [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), mostly for autoprefixing.
[Normalize CSS](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) is used as a base, but otherwise the styles are hand-written.

Most text uses the [FigTree](https://github.com/erikdkennedy/figtree/tree/master) font by The Figtree Project Authors.
Headers use the [Electrolize](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Electrolize) font by Gaslight.

Icons are from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/). They are packaged into a webfont using [svgtofont](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svgtofont).
