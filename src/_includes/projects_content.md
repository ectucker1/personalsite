Below you can find many of the games and other technical or artistic projects I've worked on.
This list is incomplete, but also doesn't discriminate by quality or potential interestingness. 
You may want to start with the highlight reel on the [home page](/).
Or you may want to see deeper cuts on my [itch.io](https://ect.itch.io/) or [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/users/ectucker1/games/) page.
