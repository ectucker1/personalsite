This page contains my submissions to Looptober 2024!
Looptober is a Fediverse/Mastodon music making challenge.
Participants make daily-ish short music tracks and post them under #Looptober.
Most submissions are electronic (us electronic people are fans of loops), but I've seen guitar, piano, and other tracks around too.
I made a particularly non-standard one for day 17 by recording myself tapping on a water bottle and adding some effects to that.

You can also find these as [posts from my Mastodon account tagged #Looptober2024](https://kind.social/@ectcetera/tagged/looptober2024).
I post there quicker than I update this page.

If you want to see some of what other people have made, check out [this page](https://looptober.glitch.me/) maintained by [Stefan Bohacek](https://stefanbohacek.com/).
Or browse #Looptober on your Fediverse instance of choice.

### Track Listing

My favorite tracks are marked with a *.

#### * Day 29

I think this would be classified as IDM? It's getting there through sheer modulation making the sounds unrecognizable over time.

Solo played on the "Future Split" patch for the excellent open-source [Surge XT](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/) synthesizer VST.

The bass in this is bouncy.
