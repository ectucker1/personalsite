My name is {{ first_name }}!
I'm a software developer with a primary focus on simulation and graphics.
I love working with lower-level code that transforms lots of data, fast.
Mostly that means I know more than my fair share of C++ tricks.

While I do plenty of that professionally, this site mostly showcases my personal projects.
I've been making games for almost 10 years now, starting with my [first Ludum Dare entry](/projects/ld32-golden-spork/) in 2015 (they got better; I swear).
I always have a side project or two going, and I'll be posting about them on [my blog](/blog).

Outside of the computer, I dabble in electronic music, Magic the Gathering, and obscure rules-light tabletop RPGs.
I'm based out of Kansas.
I'm 23 years old.
Oh, and I'm a proudly-visible trans woman!

Below you can find some of my favorite projects I've worked on.
There's a slightly more expansive list [here](/projects), though I still haven't copied over everything from my [itch.io](https://ect.itch.io/) or [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/users/ectucker1/games/) page.
