Quest For the Golden Spork was my team's entry for Ludum Dare 32 in 2015.
Back in freshman year of high school I gathered together four of my closest friends and we sat in a basement working all weekend.
This game was the result.
It was written in Java using [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/).
You can find the original game page on Ludum Dare's old site, archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20170912033618/http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview&uid=50639).

This was my first experience with a game jam, and it was an amazing, even if chaotic, time.
It's my first game to feature multiple levels, tilemaps, enemies, and character physics &mdash; all things I attempted for the first time over the weekend.
I've since competed in many game jams, including 14 Ludum Dares.

The game itself was a top-down brawler about trying to reclaim your golden spork from a cult worshipping the flying spaghetti monster.
Our main innovation in gameplay features was a shopping card used to hold your weapons (we were annoyed by the lack of realism in how many items a modern game character could carry alone).
It wasn't a good game, mind you.
The physics were slippery, hit detection was sketchy, and everything was slightly unpolished in a way only game jam games can be.

Here's a screenshot of the gameplay:
