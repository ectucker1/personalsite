Submerge was my team's entry for Ludum Dare 41.
It's one of the first to use my custom Dart game library [cobblestone](/projects/cobblestone).
You can still find and play the game from its page [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/submerge).

The game itself is an arcade shooter where you play as a submarine fighting sea monsters.
After each round, you're presented with a choice of the next encounter and possibly some upgrades.
