I like to make music!
I've dedicated this page to collecting it all.

Most of this is electronic stuff made with samples and synths, but I don't really tend to think about in terms of genres.
The game soundtracks especially can be pretty varying depending on the overall tone of the game.

## Music Challenges

I've participated in a few music making challenges.
The output here tends to be shorter and less polished but there's still interesting stuff there!

### Looptober 2024

A Fediverse/Mastodon challenge to post as many short music loops as possible in October.
Tracks are collected on [this page](/music/looptober-2024).

## Game Soundtracks

I've composed soundtracks to several of my game jam games:

Mysterious Zelda-inspired piano and strings.

Not an _official_ game jam but still something my friend and I made in a weekend.
An attempt at high-pressure electronic.
