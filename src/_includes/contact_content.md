I've left a few accounts around the web.
Here I gather and bind them together through the ritual of hyperlinking.

For casual conversation, personal questions, or low-stakes collaborative proposals:
- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@ectcetera)

For source code or comments on specific projects:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/ectucker1)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ectucker)

For playing or reviewing games:
- [itch.io](https://ect.itch.io/)
- [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/users/ectucker1/games/)

For vaguely-professional _stuff_:
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ectucker1/)

If you want an email or Discord, ask through one of those other channels.
