I've been participating in Looptober this month!

For the unfamiliar, Looptober is a Fediverse/Mastodon music making challenge.
Participants make daily-ish short music tracks and post them under #Looptober.
Most submissions are electronic (us electronic people are fans of loops), but I've seen guitar, piano, and other tracks around too.
I made a particularly non-standard one for day 17 by recording myself tapping on a water bottle and adding some effects to that.

I'm _pretty sure_ this started on Fedi but it might be ported from somewhere else.
If anyone knows, shoot me a message.

It's been a busy month for me, so I haven't been posting anything near daily with it.
But that's not really the point - I've made and shared some chunks of music I'm proud of.
That doesn't happen every month!
You can listen to them by searching for [posts from my Mastodon account tagged #Looptober2024](https://kind.social/@ectcetera/tagged/looptober2024).
I've also collected them all on [this page](/music/looptober-2024/) for posterity.

If you want to see some of what other people have been making, check out [this page](https://looptober.glitch.me/) maintained by [Stefan Bohacek](https://stefanbohacek.com/).
Or browse #Looptober on your Fediverse instance of choice.

And if you're interested in participating, there's still time!
It's a very low-pressure event and a great way to actually finish and share a bit of music.
