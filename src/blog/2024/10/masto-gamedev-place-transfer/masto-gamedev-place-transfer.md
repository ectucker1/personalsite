Just a minor logistical update - I've transferred my Mastodon account from {% relMe "@ectcetera@mastodon.gamedev.place", "https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@ectcetera" %} to {% relMe "@ectcetera@kind.social", "https://kind.social/@ectcetera" %}.

I've got no ill-will towards the admin or community there - they're the best public social media I've ever engaged with!
I really like the fediverse as a whole; lots of neat people doing neat things.

The competition is late Twitter so this is an easy victory.

But I'm spending more of my time doing music or other not-exactly-gamedev than gamedev these days and figured I should be somewhere more general-purpose.
Will probably have a dozen #Looptober posts before my next major gamedev one.

If you're following me for gamedev, I'll still be doing plenty!
Definitely want to finish [Random Bullshit Go](/projects/random-bullshit-go).
And I'm sure I'll be drawn into another game jam soon enough.

For anyone curious about the transfer process, I followed [this guide](https://kind.social/@Texan_Reverend/110167270006123376) by my new server admin [@Texan_Reverend@kind.social](https://kind.social/@Texan_Reverend).
Seems to have worked pretty smoothly.
I still have a couple pending follow requests for locked accounts I followed previously, but the rest seems to have come over basically instantly.
