I'm {{ full_name }}.
I'm a professional software developer and general purpose wanderer in stuff I find cool, computer related or otherwise.
Maybe you'll find some of it cool too!

My main interests include graphics, simulation, and game development programming.
Outside of the computer, I enjoy experimenting with with electronic music, tabletop RPGs, card games, or whatever else seems most fun at the time.

If any of that sounds like something you'd like to chat about, feel free to reach out on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@ectcetera)!

Below you can find some highlights from my portfolio, more [here](/projects).
