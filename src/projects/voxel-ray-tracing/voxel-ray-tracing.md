[This project](https://github.com/ectucker1/voxel-raytracing) is a real-time voxel raytracing renderer which I unfortunately never got around to giving a creative name.
It uses the Vulkan rendering API and provides features such as directional shadows, reflections, ambient occulsion, image based lighting, and FSR upscaling/antialiasing.
The renderer was developed as my senior capstone project at K-State!

As with any renderer there's a lot that I'd like to have added such as global illumination, better denoising, and support for larger scenes.
But it's not bad for my first experience with Vulkan!
